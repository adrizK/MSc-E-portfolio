<h1 align="center">Cybersecurity — Motivation & Roadmap 🕵️‍♂️💻</h1>

###

<h3 align="left">🎯 Motivation </h3>

<p align="left">I chose to pursue a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity due to my passion towards safeguarding digital ecosystems and solving complex security challenges. My drive stems from a genuine curiosity for emerging threats and a commitment to protect organizations, individuals, and critical infrastructure. This program aligns perfectly with my career goal of becoming a security professional who can bridge technical expertise and strategic risk management.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">✅ Experience So Far </h3>

<p align="left">Since beginning the MSc in Cybersecurity at **** university, where I've thrived on a curriculum that balances theory and hands‑on practice. I’ve completed coursework in security architecture, incident response, and threat intelligence, achieving consistently high marks. Practical labs using Kali Linux, Splunk SIEM, and VMware environments have sharpened my ability to identify vulnerabilities, analyze network traffic, and implement effective countermeasures.
